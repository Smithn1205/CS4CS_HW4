        <p>I will write a paragraph for each methodology of <a href="sdlc.html">Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC)</a>, there are many of them but I will suggest a few. My suggestion is as follows:</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li><b><u>Capability Maturity Model (CMM)</u>:</b> This model helps the company to improve their software. It provides a structed way to improve their software. It has 5 levels initial, repeatable, defined, managed, and optimizing.</li>
            <li><b><u>Waterfall Model</u>:</b> Here, the levels are arranged in the form a waterfall. Before going to the next level the previous level should be carried out. The phases of the waterfall model are requirement, design, development, testing, deployment and maintainance.</li>
            <li><b><u>V-Shaped Model</u>:</b> This model is arranged in a V shape with testing done at each stage. The design is as follows: requirement gathering and analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintainance.</li>
            <li><b><u>Structured Evolutionary Prototyping</u>:</b> In this model, you create a demo model first and let the users use it first to find out any bugs or vulnerabilities. The main steps are requirement gathering and analysis, quick design, build a prototype, initial user evaluation and refining prototype.</li>
            <li><b><u>Rapid Application Development (RAD)</u>:</b> In this type of model, the team creates few small models for users to test and improve them until the final software is ready. It helps to buld software much faster.</li>
            <li><b><u>Incremental Model</u>:</b>In this model, the team builds the software part by part. When each version is completed, it is merged together. Its phases are requirement analysis, design and development, deployment and testing and implementation.</li>
            <li><b><u>Spiral Model</u>:</b> It is one of the most important SDLC model. It follows  systematic and iterative approach. It looks like a spiral with many loops. Its phases include objective defined, risk analysis, engineering, evaluation and planning.</li>
            <li><b><u>Agile Model</u>:</b> It works in small pieces, called as sprints, to deliver and adjust the parts quickly to develop the final product. Its methods are Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Feature-driven development (FDD), Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, etc.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>Among so many SDLC methodologies the ones that are in the AGILE classification are better. Among AGILE SDLC methods, I also have a few suggestions:</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li><b><u>Scrum</u>:</b> It works on a simple idea, the team works on small parts of the projet and combine them after each part is completed. It is simple, effective and manageable.</li>
            <li><b><u>Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)</u>:</b> It focuses on delivering the project on time, keeping in mid the budget.</li>
            <li><b><u>Feature-driven development (FDD)</u>:</b> This method is structured and focuses on delivering the working features in a simple manner.</li>
            <li><b><u>Extreme Programming (XP)</u>:</b> This model focuses on customer satisfaction and frequently keeps on releasing the updates.</li>
            <li><b><u>Kanban</u>:</b> It is easy to implement. It helps the team to manage there work efficiently.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>In this Software Development and Application course of SRH Berlin, we learn the following:</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>I learnt about the fundamentals of C programming language, which is used for software development. I learnt about various concepts such as loop, strings, functions, pointers, etc. </li>
            <li>I also developed an understanding of Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), which is a process used for developing a high quality software.</li>
            <li>I also learnt about HTML & CSS, whic are used to create an interactive user friendly webpages.</li>
            <li>Also , JavaScript a language used to enhance the webpages. Here, we have used javascript to add validations to our form.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>I have used <a href="css.html">CSS</a> with the webpage and there are 3 ways to include CSS in a webpage:</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li><b><u>External CSS</u>:</b> External CSS is when a user creates a seperate page to design the webpage using CSS. The page name should end with ".css".</li>
            <li><b><u>Internal CSS</u>:</b> Internal CSS is when a user writes the CSS styles within the head tag, between a style tag.</li>
            <li><b><u>Inline CSS</u>:</b>Inline CSS is when the user writes the CSS styles infront of each line using style attribute.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>The reason CSS is used in a webpage are:</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li> CSS is used to enhance the webpage.</li>
            <li> The webpage doesn't require any extra time to load. So, it is effective.</li>
            <li> It helps to make the webpage more interactive so the users can easily navigate through the webpages.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>I have also used <a href="js.html">JavaScript</a> in webpage development. The main reason to use JavaScript are as follows:</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>JavaScript is a programming language used in HTML to add logic to the webpages.</li>
            <li>Here, I have used javascript to add input validations to the mandatory fields in the form.</li>
            <li>It also helps to increase the performance by controlling the loading and execution of other resources, such as images, videos, etc.</li>
        </ol>
