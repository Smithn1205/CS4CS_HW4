    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
        <div style="flex: 1;">
            <p>Software development life cycle (SDLC), as the name suggests, is a process used to develop a software. It is a lifecycle model, where we have to follow each and every step, without skipping any step, to succesfully develop the software.
                It is also used to test the software. The main goal to SDLC is to provide a fully functioning software which is eay to maintain and meets the user requirements.<br><br> It invloves 6 stages:
                <div class="info"> 1. <b>Planning and Requirement Analysis</b>: Planning is the most crutial step, along with planning we also have to analyse and understand the requirements of the software.</div>
                <div class="info"> 2. <b>Defining Requirements</b>: Then all the requirements of the software are specified. These requirements needs to be approved by the stakeholders, market analysts and customers.</div>
                <div class="info"> 3. <b>Designing Architecture</b>: With the requirements approved, the designers have to come up with the best architecture for the software.</div>
                <div class="info"> 4. <b>Developing Product</b>: In this stage, the developers have to develop the product or the software as per the requirements.</div>
                <div class="info"> 5. <b>Product Testing and Integration</b>: Once the software is developed, it has to be tested before it is deployed in the markets for the customers.</div>
                <div class="info"> 6. <b>Deployment and Maintenance of Products</b>: Once it is succesfully tested, it can be deployed in the global market for the customers to use it. and, it has to maintained to ensure it's smooth functioning.</div>
